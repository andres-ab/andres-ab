👉👉👉 About me

🌐 Recently relocated to Europe

📊 I'm a Data Engineer with +5 years of experience in data roles. I use data modeling, data visualization and analytics frameworks to help managers and teams answer their business questions.

🤝 I have leadership experience, owning end-to-end projects including UX research, requirements gathering, solution design, stakeholder management and collaboration, and monitoring execution.

👨‍💻 I have an Industrial Engineer background with its mix of management and analytical thinking: I can explain a business problem, set goals, take a project, understand trade-offs, write performant queries, and keep great documentation.

💼 I enjoy multidisciplinary teams, engaging with devs, business users and managers, while having space to try new things and collaborate.

💻 Experienced flexible worker with strong remote collaboration skills
